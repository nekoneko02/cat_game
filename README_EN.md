Next.js (Application Layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ Screen transitions & routing
â”œâ”€â”€ API calls & session management
â””â”€â”€ Internal state persistence

Phaser (Game Execution Layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ Rendering & input processing
â”œâ”€â”€ Game logic execution
â””â”€â”€ Stateless design

Common Modules (Infrastructure Layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ ApiClient (API wrapper)
â”œâ”€â”€ GameManager (Phaser wrapper)
â””â”€â”€ Various utilities
```

## How to Play

1. **Create Account**: Set username and cat name on first access
2. **Home Screen**: Check cat status and prepare to play
3. **Gameplay**: Move with analog stick and interact with the cat
4. **Deepen Bonds**: Spending time together increases "bonding level" with the cat

## Development Guidelines

This project is developed following these design principles:

### Time-based State Updates
- FPS-independent implementation
- State defined by amount of change per second
- Uses game time instead of real time

### Domain-Driven Design
- Structure based on domain models
- Business logic placed within domain objects
- Clear separation of responsibilities

### Session Management
- Encrypted cookies with iron-session
- Stores only username and cat's internal state
- Privacy-focused design

### Commercial Release Quality
- Retains only meaningful comments
- Proper error handling
- Adherence to security best practices

For detailed development conventions, refer to [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md).

## Cat AI System

The cat is equipped with an advanced AI system composed of the following elements:

### Emotion System
- **Comfort**: Cat's mood (-1: uncomfortable ï½ž 1: comfortable)
- **Arousal**: Activity level (-1: sleepy ï½ž 1: energetic)
- **Safety**: Sense of security in environment (-1: anxious ï½ž 1: secure)
- **Affinity**: Intimacy with user (-1: aversion ï½ž 1: affection)

### Learning Features
- Cat behavior evolves with each session
